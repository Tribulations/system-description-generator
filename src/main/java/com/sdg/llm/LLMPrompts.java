                2. **Key Components & Responsibilities:** Briefly describe the major components and their roles.
                3. **Core Technologies & Dependencies:** Explicitly confirm the technologies used and dependencies.
                4. **Architecture:** Provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture.
                5. **Data Flow:** Describe the flow of data between components.
                **Response Guidelines:**
                - Keep the summary **brief yet informative**.
